WP-Forecast
===========

It's a weather forecast plugin/widget for WordPress, powered by the National Digital Forecast Database which is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) for the most accurate weather information.

Supply a geolocation (latitude/longitude) to receive a weather forecast from anywhere on Earth.

Who it's for
------------

Anyone who wants to show a 5-day weather forecast on their WordPress site.

Roadmap
-------

**Alternate location support**

Add support for querying weather based on zip code (92807), city (Long Beach), weather tower code (KLGB), etc.

**Weather icons**

The weather icons (sunny/fog/rain) at NOAA are very basic (no alpha blending) and not lovely to look at, so the plugin includes a new set of .png weather icons. Developers should have a way to choose between multiple icon sets, and an easy way to upload their own set.

**Layout options**

Add some layout options such as: show the current day only, show a 3-day forecast, show a 5-day forecast, show day/night forecasts, show humidity and wind chill, etc. Some of this can be controlled by the developer through css, but we want it easy for the end-users to fine tune.

History
-------

This is a port of the weather forecast widget from one of my other projects, a digital signage kiosk at the Lakewood Center Mall in Southern California.

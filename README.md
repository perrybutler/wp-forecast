WP-Forecast

It's a weather forecast plugin/widget for WordPress, powered by the National Digital Forecast Database which is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) for the most accurate weather information.

Supply a geolocation (latitude/longitude) to receive a weather forecast from anywhere on Earth.

Anyone who wants to show a 5-day weather forecast on their WordPress site.

This is a port of the weather forecast widget from one of my other projects, a digital signage kiosk at the Lakewood Mall in Southern California.
